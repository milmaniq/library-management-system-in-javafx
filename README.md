# Library Management System

This system is a solution for a Library. It eases the process of Lending and Receiving books. 
When lending a book, it is important to ensure that 
the informaton related to the book as well as the information related to the member are stored in the database.
It is only then, a book can be successfully lent, and the respective lent record can be added to the database.
Further, when a lent book is returned, it must be marked as 'returned' in the database.
In addition to these functionalities, it is also possible to 
get the history of transactions (lent and returned) of a particular member. 
Therefore, it can be said that this system will ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of 
lending and receiving books in a library.
